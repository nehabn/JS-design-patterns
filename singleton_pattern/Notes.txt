# Singleton Pattern

- Instantiated once, accessed globally
- mannage global state in an application


-  The `Object.freeze` method makes sure that consuming code cannot modify the Singleton. 

- objects are passed by reference
- However, the common usecase for a Singleton is to have some sort of global state throughout your application. Having multiple parts of your codebase rely on the same mutable object can lead to unexpected behavior.

. Understandings
 - Singleton is used when we need something that is global and can be accessed from anywhere.
 - But, the thing is if you have a global state like this, it can be modified unneccesarily, that could lead to wrong value. 
 - So, it is mostly avoided in Js(Singletom is anti-pattern in Js)
 - In languages like React, we have state management tools like Redux and react context, to have a global state/value. The pros are the state can only be modified if it is needed to be by using reducer and dispatching an action.
 - Testing can be tricky, if the value is modified somewhere it is not expected to, the entire test suite is going to fail.
